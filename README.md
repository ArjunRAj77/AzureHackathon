# Azure Hackathon 

#Motivation:

The Indian government has provided public hospitals in every locality in our country.See, only a very few hospitals in India are using online services for providing healthcare assistance, and if you actually visit a hospital in India, you have to wait for hours in the queue, to just take a token or pay a bill. And since the pandemic hit, the need for an effective online system in the industry is paramount. That’s why we designed the “lifeline”.

#Objective :

Life-Line is integrated with Azure environment to built an easy to use web app, with user experience like never before. With the help of Azure, a more realiable and well maintained web app service can be created. Lifeline is an interactive web app designed to support both ends, i.e, both patients and doctors. See it reduces the time one has to spend at the hospital. Through the web app, hospitals can keep records of all their patients, and all the medical documents can be transferred through digital platforms, which makes it even more powerful. Booking an appointment online reduces the effort and time taken by the patient. Once a time slot is issued,an account is created for the patient, which stores all personal and treatment details, along with the digital copies of all diagnostic reports. This creates a unified and simple approach. The UI is designed as simple as possible. making it easier for people of all age groups to use it without difficulty. . This will help the patient to book an appointment in advance, without even coming to the hospital. All those times, waiting to get an appointment can be reduced.
